# What is this for?

In JavaScript we quite often use strings as some kind of identifiers. Event and module names are good examples here.
 
A good IDE should support this in my opinion. With this plugin you can define a format
 of your identifiers. Each JavaScript string matching this format becomes a 'symbol' which
 you can rename(Shift + F6), find usages of (Alt + F7) or Go To (CTRL + Click).
 
By default all strings in format ':hyphen-identifier' are symbols but you can configure 
recognized formats in the plugin configuration page.

Referenced symbols are shown without warning:

Symbol names will appear in the suggestions list (Ctrl + Space Bar):
